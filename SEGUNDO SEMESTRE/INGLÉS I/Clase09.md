### Modal verbs
- What are modal verbs?
  - Modal verbs show possibility, intent, ability, or necessity. Common examples of modal verbs include can, should, and must. Because they’re a type of auxiliary verb (helper verb), they’re used with theinfinitive form of the main verb of a sentence to inflect its meaning.
- Consider the difference between these two examples:
  - I swim every Tuesday.
  - I can swim every Tuesday.
- The first example is a simple factual statement. The speaker participates in a swimming activity every week on Tuesdays.
- The second example uses the modal verb can. Notice how the meaning changes slightly. The speaker does not necessarily swim every Tuesday; they’re saying that they are capable of swimming every Tuesday or that the possibility exists for them to swim every Tuesday. 

### Must, mustn’t, can, can’t, don’t have to
- We use **must, mustn’t and have to** to show strong obligation and to express ruler.
  - We use **must and mustn’t** for obligations.
  - We use **can and can’t** for possibility and ability.
  - We use **have to** for something that is necessary.
  - We use **don’t have to** for something that is not necessary.
- We can also use **should, shouldn’t, can’t and need to** to talk about rules.
