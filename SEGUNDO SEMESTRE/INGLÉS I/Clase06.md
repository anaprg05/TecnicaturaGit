### Comparatives
- We use comparative adjectives to compare two things or show change. The comparative form depends on the number of syllables in the adjective.
  - For short adjetives we add -er (than). Be careful of spelling.
  - For long adjetives we use more / les (than).
  - Some comparatives are irregular.
 
- *Structure*: in general, comparatives are used in the sentences with THAN.

      verb + comparative (adjetive + er) than
