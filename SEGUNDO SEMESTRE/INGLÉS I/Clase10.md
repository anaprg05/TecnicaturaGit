# ***Website: purpose and analytics***
## Website purpose
- Websites are designed to inform, entertain, promote or sell products or services and to share information, opinions and expertise. They may also do a combination of these things.

## Language
### Question Words (1)
- We use the question words who (for people), what/which (for things), when (for time), where (for places), why (for reasons) and how (for more details).
- We usually form questions by putting an auxiliary verb, or a modal verb, before the subject.
  - Does it suit me?
  - Has Mum called?
  - Can you get the tea?
  - Shall I pass you to Oliver?

- When the verb 'to be' is the main verb, we donâ€™t use auxiliary verbs.
  - Is Oliver there?
  - Was it good?

- We can add question words to get more or different information:
  - We use which to ask about things. We can use it with a noun.
  - We use what to ask about things.
  - We use why to ask about the reason for something.
  - We use when to ask about time. 

## Website analytics
- Website analytics is the study of website traffic to establish how a website is being used.

## Language
### A- Question Words (2)
- We use how much/ how many to ask about quantity.
- We use where to ask about places.
- We can use how + adjective / adverb to ask about degree.

- The word order in questions is:

      Question Word + Auxiliary Verb + Subject + Main Verb
- When we ask a question using a question word, the answer is not Yes / No, but information must be given.
